/* C++ Program for finding out
majority element in an array */
/*

The Boyer-Moore voting algorithm is one of the popular optimal algorithms which is used to
find the majority element among the given elements that have more than N/ 2 occurrences.
This works perfectly fine for finding the majority element which takes 2 traversals over the given elements,
 which works in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Let us see the algorithm and intuition behind its working, by taking an example â€“

Input :{1,1,1,1,2,3,5}
Output : 1
Explanation : 1 occurs more than 3 times.
Input : {1,2,3}
Output : -1
This algorithm works on the fact that if an element occurs more than N/2 times, it means
that the remaining elements other than this would definitely be less than N/2. So let us check the
