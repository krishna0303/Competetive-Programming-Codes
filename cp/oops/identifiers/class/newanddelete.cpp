//if we declare any variable or any object in program at compiler time it decide how much memory needed for each varibale but memory assign only at runtime
//at runtime programm coes to main memory and their required memory alocated for varibales or bojects

//to create an dynamic varibale use keyword new
//delete eyword is only used for deletion of DMA or dynamically allocated or created variable and their scope is through program so
//we have to delete all varibales which we have created using new keyword i.e dynamically aftwer completion of any bloc
//delete p,delete []p so here p is not delete it delete the memory which are pointed by p
