//freined function can only declare in any class they have to define outside the class
//friend function can be declare in private as welll as public because it is not a memeber functions so it not effect anything
//friend functions are very useful when we have to acees private member of different classes at the same time

//for binary operator we have to pass one argument if we have define thast function as memeber funcvtion but if we define that function as
//friend function then we have to pass two argument
//same for unary operator we have to pass nothing when that unary operator overloading function is define as member function but we have to pass 1 argument when it
//is declare as friend function
//so basically in any operator overloading using friend function then no of arguments increase by 1
