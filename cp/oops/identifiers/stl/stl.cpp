/*



why not to remove char if string is there?
agar hum char array use karte hain to speedly kam karta hai instead of string
so agar humein speed primary concern hai to char array ko use karenge and agar security and easy manipulation primary concern hai to string class ko use karenge

if we are using char array so there is no any kind of predefined method which can tell us you cant's store data more than size or array so data will store in
next memory block as well which is illegela memory so it is not safe
