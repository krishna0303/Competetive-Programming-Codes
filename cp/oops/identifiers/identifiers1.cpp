// '-3' is not a character becuase it has two symbol '-' and '3' but character can have only one symbol inside the single quote
//secondary contants are made with help of primary constant
// constant,variables,keywords(thw word or symbol which is already know by the compiler are called keywords,48 keywords are in c++)

//Lecture2
//DataTypes int(2bytes),char(1 bytes),fl0at(4bytes),double(8bytes)
/*
b=5 means 5 assign b (= assignmentr operator) it is not equal operator

*/

//Reference Variable
/*
int &y=x; here it & is not read addres of y it is wrong it statement is like this int *y=&x here we can say that & is adress of x
int &y=x here y is refernce variable and it should be intialize during declaration
in reference variable it is same as pointer it also contains the same address of some varibale but both are used in different context
like pani(pina hai) aur jal(puja path karne baithe hai)
int &y=x it meansafter this statement y is pointing to address of x and if we increament y++ it means adress value will not increase x value will increase
so basically one illusion here is now y is similar to x but it is refernce but we can all the thing on y and this changes will affect in x
